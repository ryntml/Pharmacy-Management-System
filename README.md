# Pharmacy Management System
This is a Windows Form Based Application written in C#. This program was done as the end-of-term project of the first grade in 2023. The aim of the program is to contribute to the lives of pharmacy managers and employees. 

## DataBase 
I use Microsoft Access Database in this program. 7 tables were used : calisanListesi, eczaciGiris, ilaçlar, musteriListesi, satis, sepet ve yoneticiGiris. 
These tables were used one by one in separate categories and separate forms.

## Forms
- Form1 : Opening Form.
- secimFormu : You will choose whether you are a manager or an employee.
- yoneticiGiris : For administrator login.
- eczaciGiris : For employees login.
- yonetici : Administrator page, all operations that the administrator can perform can be accessed here.
- eczaci :  Employee page, all operations that the employee can perform can be accessed here.
- satisYonetim : For sales transactions.
- satisListele : To list sales.
- calısanDuzenle : The form where operations such as adding employees are performed by the administrator.
- faturaOlustur : To create the bill of the sales made as a PDF.
